# Exercise w5.2
Write a method *intersect* that accepts two sorted array lists of integers as parameters and returns a new list that contains only the elements that are found in both lists.
- Example: if lists named list1and list2initially store: [1, 4, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17, 28, 41, 59] and  [4, 7, 11, 17, 19, 20, 23, 28, 37, 59, 81]
- Then the call of intersect(list1, list2) returns the list:[4, 11, 17, 28, 59]
